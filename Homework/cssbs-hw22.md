1. Explain the difference between the concepts of associativity and precedence.
defines whether the operation evaluates from right to left. Procedence is vertical and associativity is horizantal.

2. Explain the difference between the concepts of binary and unary operators.
Binary works on 2 operation, unary has two operator.

3. List four constraints imposed by C# with respect to operator overloading. pg 494


4. What is the syntax for overloading operators? Discuss access, scope, return value types, and parameter types and multiplicity. pg 494
pg 495

5. What are symmetric overloaded binary operators and how do they differ from non-symmetric overloaded binary operators?


6. Can you overload compound assignment operators? If so, please state how you do so. If not, explain why not.
No, because it's already overloading.

7. What is the difference between overloading increment and decrement operators for value types and reference types?
Reference type you are referencing a memory.

8. Why do we overload some operators in pairs?
they come in pairs and have to be symmetric. 

9. What is the difference between widening conversion and narrowing conversion? msdn


10. What is the difference between explicit conversion and implicit conversion?
